2. Setup a Node.js environment.

3. npm install dependencies

4. Get Aylien API credentials.

5. Create a .env file that contains your API credentials

6. Start server and open index.html

## Runtime Environment
Any modern web browser and Node.js with npm

## Steps Taken To Build App

The following tasks were completed in this project:

* Setup the Node.js environment.
* Added the express, body-parser, and cors modules to Node.
* Ran the local server and printed out logs to the Command Line.
* Created API credentials with Aylien NLP
* The personal API key is stored in a .env file for safe keeping.
* Utilize webpack to organize and load files
* Utilize webpack-dev-server to edit code in a dev friendly environment
* Data is successfully received from the Aylien API.
* Implemented POST routes on both the client and the server.
* Dynamically display app data.
* Add event listener to the form button using JS.
* Use simple jest test to learn the basics
* Use service workers to cache app for offline use
